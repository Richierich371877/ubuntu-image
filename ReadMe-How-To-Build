Run the following command to build the image:

docker build . -t myimage:v1

List images to see your image tagged myimage:v1 in the table.

docker images

Now that your image is built, run it as a container with the following command:

docker run -dp 8080:8080 myimage:v1

Run the curl command to ping the application as given below.

curl localhost:8080

Now to stop the container we use docker stop followed by the container id. The following command uses docker ps -q to pass in the list of all running containers:

docker stop $(docker ps -q)

Check if the container has stopped by running the following command.

docker ps
