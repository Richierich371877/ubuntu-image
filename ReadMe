# MySQL and WordPress Deployment in Kubernetes

This repository contains YAML configurations for deploying MySQL and WordPress in Kubernetes. It includes configurations for data persistence, secure handling of sensitive information, and additional annotations for security and reliability.

## Overview

The deployment consists of two main components:

1. MySQL: A relational database management system used for storing WordPress data.
2. WordPress: A content management system used for creating and managing websites.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have the following:

- Access to a Kubernetes cluster.
- Kubernetes Dashboard or `kubectl` configured to manage the cluster.
- Base64-encoded passwords for MySQL and WordPress.

## Deployment Steps

Follow these steps to deploy MySQL and WordPress in your Kubernetes cluster:

1. **Create Secrets:**
   - Create Kubernetes Secrets for MySQL and WordPress. Use base64-encoded passwords for sensitive information.

2. **Persistent Storage:**
   - Create Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) for MySQL to ensure data persistence.

3. **Deploy MySQL:**
   - Deploy MySQL using the provided Deployment and Service YAML files.

4. **Deploy WordPress:**
   - Deploy WordPress using the provided Deployment and Service YAML files. Ensure the WordPress deployment has the necessary environment variables to connect to MySQL.

5. **Access WordPress:**
   - Access the WordPress application through the LoadBalancer service created. Use the provided external IP address to access the WordPress site.
